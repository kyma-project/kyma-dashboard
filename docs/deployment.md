# Deployment model

## Makefile targets

- `release-{ENV}`: consists of steps:

  - Build and push frontend image: `extensions.yaml` and `config.yaml` are added.
  - Build and push backend image: `config.yaml` is added.
  - Build and push local iamge: `extensions.yaml` and `config.yaml` are added.

- `build` - requires `ENV` (dev, stage, prod) and `TARGET` (web, backend, frontend) variables. Transforms normal Busola images into Kyma-Dashboard images by adding `config.yaml` (and `extensions.yaml`, for frontend (`web`) and standalone Docker (`local`)). The environment (`ENV`) and the image version are read from environment-specific `env` file.

- `push` - requires `ENV` (dev, stage, prod) and `TARGET` (web, backend, frontend) variables. Tags and pushes the image create on `build` stage.

## `dev` synchronisation

- `kyma-dashboard` repository watches the `busola` repository and when change occurs, it updates the images in `environments/dev/env.conf`. - TODO
- `busola-deploy/dev` picks up changes in `env.conf`, `config.yaml` and `extensions.json` and updates the image on `dashboard.dev`. TODO

## Updating `stage`

Only updating the files in `kyma-dashboard` repository is needed - `busola-deploy/stage` should pick up changes and update the `dashboard.stage` - TODO

## Updating `prod`

We would need to manually update the files both here and on `busola-deploy/prod`.
